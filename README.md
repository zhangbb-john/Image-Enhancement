# Image-Enhancement
In this project, we study image enhancement to improve the robustness of loop closure process in a SLAM system. We compare a image enhancement technique based on GAN with some model-based methods. 

The GAN-based method is based on **Tensorflow2** framework. The code is modified from [WaterGAN](https://github.com/zhangbb-john/WaterGAN), which is based on **Tensorflow1** framework. Many changes on the network structure have been made.

# Comparion
This method were compared with other methods including:
* DCP

* UDCP
# Metrics
In order to evaluate the methods, some metrics were leveraged in this project
